Introduction.
In particular, this HR Management System project in PHP CodeIgniter focuses mainly on keeping track of the company with respect to their employees. Also, the system displays all the categories with their respective details. In addition, the system allows managing departments, assets, payroll, projects, and more. Evidently, this project contains an admin panel with an employee panel as well. In an overview of this web application, an employee has a minor role and control over the system. He/she can manage personal profiles, view assigned projects and tasks. Here, an employee can process his/her leave application by filling up the required details. All the leave applications are sent for approval status from the administrator. However, the admin has the right to set employee’s account. By default, the system automatically sets these users’ login details as their contact numbers.

Administrative Panel and Employee Management.
An administrator has full control over the system. He/she can manage users, departments, designations, payroll, and so on. Here, each and every section has its own respective details such as name and other important details which is a kind of mandatory field. Here, an admin first has to set up various departments and designations in order to fill up their respective staff members. Second, the user has to manage employees with respect to their departments, designation, and other details. In fact, there is a large number of fields in order to be fulfilled by the admin or by the employee. These fields consist of topics regarding their address, experience, banking details, social media handles, salary details, and more. To be honest, this whole system works and is more than an employee management system or a payroll management system. As it contains a wide range of important features.

Attendance Management System.
Each organization or a company must have its own attendance system, so this particular project contains a simple attendance system too. In order to maintain proper attendance of staff members, the administrator can simply put up a bulk attendance or a single one. To be precise, the user has to select any of the available employees, set their check-in/out time and locations of their work. As a result, the system automatically calculates their total working hours. Besides, the administrator can list all the attendance as well as view the attendance report. For this, the user has to input months and select an employee. Whereas, an employee does not have access to view his/her own attendance report or control it through any means. Meaning, all these controls fall upon the hands of the administrator only.


Employee Leave Management System.
Employee leave management system is also known as one of the key features of the human resource system. As mentioned earlier, an employee can process their leave application from their own respective account. The only thing is that an admin has the right to control their approval status. Here, an admin can simply look upon their leave subject, reason, and total duration. And after that, the user either has to approve or decline the leave application. Regarding leave history, the employee, as well as admin members, can have a brief overview of each. In fact, the system allows fetching a total of remaining leave days for each employee. Moreover, the admin can also process the leave application form by selecting any of the employees. With it, this particular section completes the whole meaning of the employee leave management system by having its essential aspects on to the system.

Project and Task Management System.
On one hand, the admin can add a list of projects under various categories. Such as upcoming, running, and completed. Here, the administrator has to provide a few details regarding the project such as name, summary, description, starting and ending dates. After the management of the project for the company, now an admin can assign multiple tasks to multiple active employees. The best thing about this is that the system allows adding a project leader with a number of collaborators in order to complete it. In fact, we can call it teamwork within the company set by the admin. Moreover, the employee can view details regarding their assigned task from their own respective account too. In addition to it, there’s also a field visit section where an admin can manage employees under the section too. Besides, the project section requires a number of other details such as work files.


 
Employee Payroll Management System.
With it, here comes an important section for this system. The very first thing to mention out here is that each employee must have their salary details filled up in order to make it work out for payroll. As soon as the employee has their salary details, he/she is eligible for the payroll process. It’s quite simple and worth mentioning because the system requires the name of the employee, their salary months in order to fetch their total salaries. Here, the admin has to set up salary arrangements and provide some information if he/she has some deduction parts. If not, the system generates a payroll slip. But before that, the admin has the right to select a method of payment and payment status. In addition to it, the system generates a payment slip with all the important salary details. Also, the user can print out the payment invoices too.

Loan Management System.
Talking about the employee loan management section, this particular section allows the system to have records of employees’ loan status. Here, employees’ loan status refers to a condition where the company can grant some loan to their employees under a special condition. Talking furthermore about it, an employee can take up to their requested amount as a loan lent from the company. For this, an admin has to provide various details. Such as employee name, amount, install period, install amount, loan number, status, and other details. Additionally, the admin can manage installment loans with similar procedures. To be precise, an admin has full control over it too as he/she needs to grant or reject the application. Also, all the loan amounts are referred to during the payroll of a particular employee in the form of deduction.

Company Asset Management System.
After all, the system also requires a proper record for the calculation of their assets too. Before stepping onto further, the user has to first manage asset categories. This section requires information on category types and brand names. After the management of categories, now the user can manage and list out asset details. Here, the user needs to provide the name of the asset, category, model, code, purchase date, configuration, price, and quantity. With it, the system also allows managing logistic support details. For this, the admin has to provide category, employee, task, project, assign quantity, starting and ending dates with short remarks. In short, this whole section helps the user to have a quick overview of their company’s asset with logistic support too.

Notice Management, System Settings and More.
On the other hand, the system administrator can make certain announcements as a notice to all their employees. For this, an admin has to enter the notice title, upload an attachment with an effective date. In fact, the notice board is presented on every account’s dashboard as the secondary focus. Regarding system settings, the user can make changes to the application’s logo, title, description, address, and others. Moreover, the admin can have a detailed report on the leave details of each employee member. Furthermore, the system allows managing holidays for the employee where the employee can have information regarding their days off. In addition to it, the administrator has the right to manage earned leaves for each employee member. Besides, each level accounts can manage its own to-do list task from the dashboard with ease.

Last but not least, a clean and simple dashboard is presented with various color combinations for greater user experience while using this Online Human Resource Management System Project in PHP MySQL CodeIgniter.
