Introduction.
In particular, this HR Management System project in PHP CodeIgniter focuses mainly on keeping track of the company with respect to their employees. Also, the system displays all the categories with their respective details. In addition, the system allows managing departments, assets, payroll, projects, and more. Evidently, this project contains an admin panel with an employee panel as well. In an overview of this web application, an employee has a minor role and control over the system. He/she can manage personal profiles, view assigned projects and tasks. Here, an employee can process his/her leave application by filling up the required details. All the leave applications are sent for approval status from the administrator. However, the admin has the right to set employee’s account. By default, the system automatically sets these users’ login details as their contact numbers.
